## Activity 6: LA homes {.flexbox .vcenter}

![david](http://media.mnn.com/sites/default/files/YoungwoodCour2.jpg)

Can we predict the selling price of homes in LA based only on knowledge of
its square footage?

##
```{r eval = FALSE}
LA <- read.csv("http://andrewpbray.github.io/data/LA.csv")
plot(price ~ sqft, data = LA)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
m1 <- lm(price ~ sqft, data = LA)
LA <- transform(LA, 
                logprice = log(price),
                logsqft = log(sqft),
                sqrtsqft = sqrt(sqft))
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
plot(logprice ~ logsqft, data = LA)
m2 <- lm(logprice ~ logsqft, data = LA)
abline(m2, col = "orange", lwd = 2)
plot(m2)
```


## Takeaways {.build}
- Model building is an iterative process.
- You can fit any model that you like, but to draw inferences/conclusions from
it, it needs to be a valid model.
- "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
- Models are used for *prediction* and *description*.

## In your groups {.build}
- Introduce yourself (name, hometown, major, interests)
- Exchange emails
- Start brainstorming topics

Decide upon 3-5 questions that you find interesting and which may be addressed 
through the collection and analysis of data. Examples:

- What is the role of executive compensation in predicting company performance?
- How does the percentage of Massachusetts high school seniors going on to four-year 
colleges relate to town and school characteristics?
- How can we predict real estate prices in South Hadley?

**Topics due on moodle Wednesday at 3pm**
