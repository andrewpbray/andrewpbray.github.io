## Dataframe: nc
<div class="columns-2">
![baby](http://smashinghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BP-33.jpg)

```{r}
download.file("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/nc.RData",
              destfile = "nc.RData")
load("nc.RData")
```

- What are the dimensions?
- What mode of data is in each column? (`head()`)
</div>



## Dataframe: nc {.build}

```{r}
class(nc)
dim(nc)
length(nc)
```


## Dataframes
1. What `attributes()` does this dataframe have?
2. What happens when you convert this dataframe into a matrix?


## Subsetting columns {.build}
`$` is an operator used to access a column (vector) from a dataframe.

```{r}
head(nc$fage)
length(nc$fage)
```

It can be subsetted just like a vector.

```{r}
nc$fage[3]
```


## Subsetting as a matrix {.build}
You can also subset the whole dataframe like a matrix.  What do you think the 
following commands do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nc[1:10, 1:2]
nc[1, ]
nc[nc$gender == "female", "premie"]
```

Note that the last command could be written also using vector subsetting.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nc$premie[nc$gender == "female"]
```


## Two ways to subset {.build}

1. **Subset by index**: specify inside the square bracks exactly which elements
    you want.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    nc$gender[1:10]
    ```

2. **Subset by logical**: specify conditions inside brackets with logical operators
    that will evaluate to a T/F vector of the same length as that being subsetted.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    nc$gender[nc$premie == "premie"]
    ```

    Note that the vector that you're using to specify the condition can be 
    different from the one you're subsetting, but it has to be of the same length.


## Functions on vectors

There are many statistical functions that take a vector as an argument (`mean()`,
`sum()`, `median()`, `sd()`, `max()`, `min()`, etc.) that can also be used to subset.

```{r}
nc[nc$mage == max(nc$mage), ]
```


##

Fix the following subsetting errors using data from `nc`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nc[nc$visits = 4, ]
nc[-1:4, ]
nc[nc$visits <= 5]
nc[nc$visits == 4 | 6, ]
```
