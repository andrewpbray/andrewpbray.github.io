# Honest Liars

## The managers

First, we need two managers.

```{r eval = FALSE}
students <- c("Aidan", "Leah", "Mary", "Laura", "Rose", "Marc", "Jamie",
              "Dashiel", "Sophie", "Julien", "Aliyyah", "Raphaela", 
              "Mason", "Lauren", "Kathryn", "Hannah", "Karl", "Anna", 
              "Sarah", "Sarah", "Gabe", "Delenn", "Sierra", "Renee")
sample(students, size = 2)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
students <- c("Aiman", "Edwin", "Sara", "Alex", "Carolyn", "Zackary", 
              "Katie", "Alexandra", "Grace", "Daniel", "Nikki", "Ryan",
              "Haley", "Kate", "Malcolm", "John", "Ryan", "Jack", 
              "Jiahui", "Gabriel")
sample(students, size = 2)
```


## The employees

You will need two random digits between 0-9.

- Digit 1: Last digit of your Reed ID #
- Digit 2: 5th digit of your phone num (excluding area code)

Please write these on a sheet of paper.


## The context

<img src="../figs/employee-theft.png" alt="theft" width="750">


## Honest or thief? {.build}

It is thought that 10% of retail employees are thieves. To simulate this, using
your first random digit:

- If your digit = 0, write "thief" above your first digit.
- If your digit = 1-9, write "honest" above your first digit.


## Pass or fail? {.build}

Your managers now administer a lie detector test that is 80% accurate;
there is an 80% change that thieves will fail the test and an 80% chance that 
honest folk will pass the test. Using your second random digit,

- Thieves
    - If your digit = 0 or 1, write "pass" above that digit.
    - If your digit = 2 - 9, write "fail" above that digit.
- Honest folk
    - If your digit = 0 or 1, write "fail" above that digit.
    - If your digit = 2 - 9, write "pass" above that digit.
