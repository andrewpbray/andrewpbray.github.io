When you buy a book off of Amazon, you get a quote for how much it
costs to ship. This is based on the weight of the book. If you
didn't know the weight a book, what other characteristics of it
could you measure to help predict weight?

```{r getdata, echo = FALSE}
library(DAAG)
data(allbacks)
allbacks <- allbacks[, c(3, 1, 4)]
```

## Example: shipping books
```{r plotallbacks}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, data = allbacks)
```


##  {.build}
