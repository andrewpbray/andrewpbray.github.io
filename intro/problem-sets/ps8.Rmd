This problem set combines an analysis of our class data with a few problems
from the book. Please create a new Rmd file to do the analysis below. The 
problems can be done either in the same Rmd file or written out on a separate
sheet of paper. Please knit the Rmd, *print* out the html file (on paper), and
turn it all in (stapled!) on Monday.

### Taking a look at ourselves

We now have a data set that captures some aspects of the working/sleeping lives
of the students in Math 141. That data can be downloaded from the class website
as a .csv file. To get this data into RStudio server, please follow the following
steps:

1. Save the .csv file to your local machine.
2. Log into the RStudio server.
3. In the lower right pane, with the Files tab selected, click "Upload" and
navigate to where saved the data locally.
4. Once you see `class-data.csv` in your Files tab, run the following line of
code:
```{r read-data}
d <- read.csv("class-data.csv")
```
5. Click on `d` in your Environment and take a look at the column names (survey
questions).
6. For ease of typing, run the following line to shorten those names.
```{r rename, tidy = TRUE}
names(d) <- c("time", "year", "identity", "stats_hrs",
              "all_hrs", "sleep_hrs", "job", "grad_school")
```

### Data Visualization

A good way to begin exploring this data is by visualizing it. Choose some 
questions / variables that are interesting to you and generate an appropriate and 
informative plot. You should create one plot for each of the following categories:

1. One categorial variable
2. One numerical variable
3. The relationship between two categorical variables
4. The relationship between a categorial variable and a numerical variable

`qplot()` can be used for all of these. To generate a stacked bar plot, you can
use the following syntax.
```{r stacked-bar, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = variable1, fill = variable2, geom = "bar")
```
Beneath every plot, please describe the structure and trends in the data.

### Inference

We might wonder if the structure and trends that we see in our sample of data
are indicative of some greater trend in the Reed student body. Let's consider
our class to be a random sample of the students at Reed. Please carry out an
inferential procedure - either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test - for
the same four categories above (for a total of four procedures).
