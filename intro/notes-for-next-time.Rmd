# Textbook

- **Definition of p-value** (ch. 2): What's this business about "favorable to 
the null hypothesis?" For decisions, can we move to "data is consistent/inconsistent
with the model"?

- **Consider removing 2.3.6**: Isn't it simpler to say, "always use two-sided
tests?" If we spend time on how not to lie with statistics, I'd opt for a discussion
of multiple comparisons.


# General

- Spend more time on data visualization before continuing on to probability/inference.
Consider moving around sampling/design a bit.

- Don't forget to use the Salish Sea Feet example for hypothesis testing.

- Gather examples from previous senior theses
