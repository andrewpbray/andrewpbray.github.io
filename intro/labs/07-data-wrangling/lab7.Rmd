<div id="boxedtext">
This lab is a bit different from the others. We'll be working through the exercises
together as a class, but be sure to record them in your lab report like normal. 
You can find these exercises in the slides, which are posted [here](data-wrangling.html). 
The On Your Own component will be as usual, on your own (or in pairs). To be sure you
have all the necessary packages loaded, be sure to add the following chunk at the top
of your lab report.
</div> 

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(oilabs)
library(pnwflights14)
```

## On your own

For the following questions, it may be helpful to sketch out what you want the
final data set to look like (what are the rows? what are the columns?), then
work backwards to figure out how to create that dataset from the original data.

- The plot below displays the relationship between the mean arrival delay and the mean distance travelled by every plane in the data set. It also shows the total
number of flights made by each plane by the size of the plotted circle. Please
form the chain necessary to create the dataset that lies underneath this plot. 
You will also want to exclude the edge cases from your analysis, so focus on the
planes that have logged more than 20 flights and flown an average distance of 
less than 2000 miles.

- Once you have that dataset, you can check your answer by using the following 
code to generate the plot. What does the relationship appear to be between mean distance that planes fly and their mean arrival delay?
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(delay, aes(dist, delay)) +
 geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/2) +
 geom_smooth() +
 scale_size_area()
```

- Say you live halfway between Portland and Seattle. Based on the 2014 data,
which airport should you fly out of to minimize overall delays? (however you
define them)

- Say you fly very often between PDX airport in Portland and JFK airport in 
New York. Which day of the week would you recommend that I buy a ticket for if I
want to minimize delays? Any tips for the best airlines to go through?


**Challenge**: Remake two plots that show up in the slides - the points plot of average
delays by carrier and the bar chart of total count of flights by carrier out of PDX - 
but display the carriers in descending order.
