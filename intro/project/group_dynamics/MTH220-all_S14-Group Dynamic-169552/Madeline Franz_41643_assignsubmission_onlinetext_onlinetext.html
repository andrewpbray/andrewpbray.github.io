<html><body><div class="no-overflow"><p>This group was very strong overall, and everyone was good about getting their work done and pulling their own weight. We all had busy schedules, but we made time to meet up and finish each segment of the project. Everyone was good about showing up and focusing at the agreed times or about collaborating when we used Google Docs.</p>

<p>34 %-Emma Sisson</p>
<p>            Emma was very comfortable coding on R. When Nomfuneko or I had ideas on how to manipulate the data, Emma knew how to make R do it.</p>

<p>34%-Madeline Franz</p>
<p>            I was not as good at remembering code as Emma, but I was good about understanding the concepts and troubleshooting issues with R. Like Emma and Nomfuneko, I did my part when preparing for the presentation and working on written portions.</p>

<p>32%-Nomfuneko Mafunda</p>
<p>            Nomfuneko worked hard and was a useful member of the group. The only reason I rated her a bit lower is because she didn’t always do the background work to understand what we were working on. It would take a little time to bring her back up to speed, but once there she was very helpful and productive.</p></div></body></html>
