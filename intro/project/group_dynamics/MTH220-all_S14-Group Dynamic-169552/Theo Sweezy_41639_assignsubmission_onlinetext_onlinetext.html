<p dir="ltr"><span>Every member of our group put in equal time and effort on this project (so far as I can tell). Keara was particularly good and patient the R code. She was persistent in checking models and catching other peoples coding mistakes. Emma excelled at putting our work and ideas into intelligent sentences. She made sure that what we were saying made sense (it didn’t always). I did a lot of the organizing of the documents/presentation, and did whatever else didn’t seem to be getting done/what other people didn’t seem to want to do. </span></p>
