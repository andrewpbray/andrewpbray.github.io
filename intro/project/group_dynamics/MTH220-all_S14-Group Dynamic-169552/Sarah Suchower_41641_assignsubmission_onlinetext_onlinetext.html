<html><body><div class="no-overflow"><p>Overall, I was satisfied with how the work was divided up. Because Celeste and I have been working with this data all year, we were much more familiar and could work at a faster pace than Kayla. Celeste and I talked with our research professor during lab meetings to see what he wanted us to do. Celeste did a lot of work on the project proposal, with Kayla and me helping to edit and elaborate on different points, as well as discussing what our variables were. I did most of the R-code, with Kayla and Celeste helping when I was stuck and needed new ideas. Celeste did a lot of work on the presentation, with Kayla doing a lot of the work to arrange the stuff I put in. Celeste and Kayla did the majority of collecting the material to put in the handout, and I then rearranged it to the pamphlet format. The technical report didn’t take very much additional work because I did the original coding in a markdown and wrote stuff in as we worked through the different tests, but Kayla and Celeste both helped with analysis. Overall, I feel that the work was divided up in the way that was most efficient for our group and allowed us to work optimally.  </p>
