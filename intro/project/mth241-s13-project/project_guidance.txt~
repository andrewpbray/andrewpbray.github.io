MTH241 (Probability and Statistics)  Spring 2013
Additional Project Guidance and Reminders
========================================================

* Just a quick reminder: the final ARTIST assessment (post-test) is due tonight at midnight.  This will count twice as much as a regular ARTIST assessment.  As always, you will receive full credit for a good faith effort.  Please budget 30-40 minutes for this. 

* There is some unintended ambiguity in the project assignment document. This document may at times refer to a "report" as well as a "technical appendix". In fact, these are the same (the report is the technical appendix). To be perfectly clear: You will submit *only one* written document for your project (whether you think of it as a report or a technical appendix). 

* When you submit the aforementioned document, please submit it as *two* files: one R Markdown file (.Rmd file extension) and the corresponding rendered output (the .html file that is generated when you click "Knit HTML"). We will attempt to knit your Markdown file on our computers, making it critical that you store your data file in your Dropbox folder. The deadline for this submission is midnight on Thursday, 5/2. 

* In your reports, be sure to correctly interpret the coefficients from your model.  In particular, recall that they are "conditional" on other terms in the model. Note that the interpretation of the coefficients is for most groups the most critical quantitative piece of the project, and thus should not be relegated to parenthetical mention. 

Here are some thoughts from yesterday's presentations, which were by and large hugely successful:

* assessment of linearity and assessment of equal variance are different (though you can assess both from the plots of residuals vs fitted or residuals vs. quantitative predictors).  If the smooth line is close to the straight line, then the relationship is approximately linear.  If there's a fan shaped pattern, then there's some evidence for heteroskedasticity.  The plot of the "Scale-Location" is to my eye, an easier way to assess this.  If the smooth curve is flat then there's no evidence for heteroskedascity.

* please ensure that no stray "P(>|t|)"  (should be "p-value") or 2e-16 (should be <0.0001) creep into your presentation.  Same for Adjusted R^2 (something that we've never encouraged you to report).


As always, best wishes for the balance of the semester.
