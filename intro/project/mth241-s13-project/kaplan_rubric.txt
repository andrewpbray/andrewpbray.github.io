Overall: Read through your document, as the instructor would.
* Are there any error statements from R?
* Is there any extraneous text?
* Are basic formatting features correct? e.g. section headers, bullet points.

The variables:
* Is there a concise, mnemonic name?
* Has there been some description of the levels (or scale, if quantitative)?
* Is there a codebook as part of the appendix?

Are the graphics informative?
* Are ordinal variables being shown in order?
* Are the labels legible?  (Use las=2 to rotate the labels)
* Are the variables clearly indicated?

The models?
* Is a hypothesis provided to justify the structure of the model?
* Is the report informative?
    * Effect size: give coefficients
    * Significance: ANOVA might be more important here

Extraneous content
* Is there excess verbiage?
* Are unnecessary aspects of the computer output provided.
    * Example: You don't need to document the output of the run that provided your sample size.  Just a statement of which model you ran and what simulated sample size was needed to generate a low p-value.

Technicalities
* Are there any error messages in your R output?  (e.g. wrongly named variables)
* Are links and iframes functioning?  The reader should not need special permission to access such things.

Grammar and meaning:
* "The majority of students answering the survey were Female for unknown reasons."  Presumably genetic.
