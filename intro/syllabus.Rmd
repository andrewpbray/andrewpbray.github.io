*STAT 340, Fall 2014*  
*Instructor: Andrew Bray*  

Description An application-oriented introduction to modern statistical modeling and inference:
study design, descriptive statistics, data visualization, random variables, probability and sampling
distributions, point and interval estimates, hypothesis tests, resampling procedures, and multiple
regression. A wide variety of applications from the natural and social sciences will be used. Classes
meet for lecture/discussion with activities and exercies that emphasize analysis of real data using R
and RStudio.
MTH 220 is intended to satisfy the basis requirement in introductory statistics for Biological
Science, Economics, Engineering, Environmental Science, Neuroscience and Psychology majors.
Prerequisite: MTH 111 or MTH 153 or one year of high school calculus, or permission of the
instructor. Students who have not taken calculus should consider MTH 190 (Statistical Methods for
Undergraduate Research, which also satisfies the basis requirement for the psychology department),
SOC 201, GOV 190 or MTH 107 (Statistical Thinking).

### Textbook

OpenIntro: Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation (2014),
by Diez, Barr and \c{C}etinkaya-Rundel, available in three formats: pdf, tablet-friendly pdf, and pa-
perback edition. The textbook is free and open-source; the digital editions can be accessed at
http://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook2014.php and a paperback book will be distributed to
each student in class. Be sure to use this link!
The textbook is not just a reference to use after the instructor has presented new material but a
sourcebook to use at every stage of learning. When all students read the text before class, the nature
of the class meeting changes to the benefit of everyone. You will have thought about the material,
and you will arrive with your own questions. You'll be ready to discuss what you understand, to
clarify what you don't understand, and to hear more on the topic. You need to read the book prior
to class as well as review the material after we've discussed it in class.
You will be asked to make and respond to reading notes online, as class time will focus on
activities to help understand concepts. You should also

#### Labs

We meet in laboratory every Tuesday to tinker around with data and statistics.
Our tools of choice are R and RStudio, software that vastly amplifies your power
to explore, visualize, and model data. Reed's RStudio server is accessible by
going to [https://rstudio.reed.edu/](https://rstudio.reed.edu/) and using your
college login.

Every week you'll be working with a new data set and organizing your work in an
RMarkdown document. These will be submitted through moodle and will be due the
following Monday morning at 10 am.
