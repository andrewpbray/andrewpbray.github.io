### The Problem

In  1981,	two	new	varieties	of	a	tiny	biting	insect	called a	midge	were
discovered	by	biologists	W.	L.	Grogan	and	W.	W.	Wirth	in	the	jungles	
of	Brazil.	They	dubbed	one	kind	of	midge	an	Apf midge	and	the	other	an
Af midge.	The	biologists	found	out	that the	Apf midge	is	a	carrier	of a
debilitating	disease	that	causes	swelling	of	the	brain	when	a	human	is
bitten	by	an	infected	midge.	Although	the	disease	is	rarely	fatal,
the	disability	caused	by	the	swelling	may	be	permanent.	The	other	form
of	the	midge,	the	Af,	is	quite	harmless	and	a	valuable	pollinator.	In
an	effort	to	distinguish	the	two	varieties,	the	biologist	took	measurements
on	the	midges	they	caught.	The	two	measurements	taken	were of	wing	length
(WL)	and	antennae	length	(AL),	both	measured	in	centimeters.  You can load
the data with the following command.

```{r}
midges <- read.csv("http://andrewpbray.github.io/data/midges.csv")
```


#### Your Mission

Is	it	possible	to	distinguish	an	Af	midge	from	an	Apf	midge	on	the	
basis	of	wing	and	antenna	length?		Your	groupâ€™s	task	is	to	develop	
**specific** instructions	that a	naturalist	in	the	field	could	use to	classify
a	midge	he or she	has	just	captured.

Once you've come up with a rule, apply your method to three specimens with 
(antenna, wing) lengths (1.24, 1.80), (1.28, 1.84), (1.40, 2.04).

Assume that species Af is a valuable pollinator and species Apf is a carrier
of a debilitating disease. Would you modify your classification scheme
and if so, how?
