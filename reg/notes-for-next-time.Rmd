### Week 1
- have the dataframe be the central data structure, not the vector
- use dplyr for data manipulation

### Week 2
- distinguish between plotting the data (dotplot, scatterplot, barchart, mosaic 
plot) and functional summaries of the data (histogram, density plots).
- densities as a way to approximate the true/population distribution.
- show the visualization approximations of $f_hist (x)$, $f_kd (x)$, $f_kd (x, y)$, 
$f_kd (y | x)$.
- the assocation we see in a scatterplot is essentially answering the question of
what we'd expect for $f_kd (y | x)$ for a series of x's.
- From data to distributions
- Assign more readings/hw during the first two weeks.  Have some sort of rigorous
assessment at the end of week 2.
