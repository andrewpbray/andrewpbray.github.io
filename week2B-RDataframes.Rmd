## Vector Indexing

Consider the vector `x <- c(12,15,8,11,24)`.  How do we create a vector of the
differences between adjacent elements?

```{r}
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
x[-1] - x[-length(x)]
```

Work in vectors instead of loops where possible.


## Vector Subsetting/Filtering {.build}
What's going on here?

```{r}
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
x[x < 10]
x < 10
```

We can index our vector with a logical vector of the same length.


## Subsetting with logicals {.build}

```{r}
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
i <- c(F, F, T, F, F)
x[i]
which(x < 10)
x[x < 10] <- 10
x
```


## Useful fact!  {.build}

```{r}
i <- c(F, F, T, F, F)
sum(i)
mean(i)
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
mean(x > 11)
```


## Logical operators

<div class="columns-2">
`<` less than

`<=` less than or equal

`>` greater than

`>=` greater than or equal

`==` exactly equal to

`!=` not equal to

`!x` not equal to x

`x | y` x or y

`x & y` x and y
</div>


## {.build}

How can you subset the following vector to exclude both elements less than 10 
and all even elements? (hint: `%%`)

```{r}
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
```


## Activity: Vector Generation and Subsetting


## From Vectors to Matrices {.build}

Consider the vector

```{r}
v <- letters
length(v)
```

we can turn this into a matrix.

```{r}
m <- matrix(v, nrow = 2)
length(m)
dim(m)
```


## From Vectors to Matrices {.build}

```{r}
m <- matrix(v, nrow = 2)
m
```

By default, R will spool the vector into a matrix by first filling the columns.
Which argument can we tweak to change this? (`?matrix`)

`matrix(v, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)`



## Matrix Subsetting {.build}

Square brackets again, but with [rows, columns].

```{r}
m[2, 3]
m[2, 2:4]
m[, 3]
```

Leaving a blank means "all".


## Data structures in R

1. **Vector:** homogeneous groups of integers, numerics, logicals, characters.
Scalars are just vectors of length one.

2. **Matrix:** vectors with an additional dimension attributes (also homogeneous).

3. **Dataframe:** matrix of heterogeneous columns of the same length.


## Dataframe: nc

![baby](http://smashinghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BP-33.jpg)

```{r}
download.file("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/nc.RData", destfile = "nc.RData")
load("nc.RData")
```

- What are the dimensions?
- What mode of data is in each column? (`head()`)


## Dataframe: nc

```{r}
class(nc)
dim(nc)
length(nc)
```


## Dataframes
1. What `attributes()` does this dataframe have?
2. What happens when you convert this dataframe into a matrix?


## Subsetting columns {.build}
`$` is an operator used to access a column (vector) from a dataframe.

```{r}
head(nc$fage)
length(nc$fage)
```

It can be subsetted just like a vector.

```{r}
nc$fage[3]
```



## Subsetting as a matrix {.build}
You can also subset the whole dataframe like a matrix.  What do you think the 
following commands do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nc[1:10, 1:2]
nc[1, ]
nc[nc$gender == "female", "premie"]
```

Note that the last command could be written also using vector subsetting.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nc$premie[nc$gender == "female"]
```


## Functions on vectors

There are many statistical functions that take a vector as an argument (`mean()`,
`sum()`, `median()`, `sd()`, `max()`, `min()`etc.) that can also be used to subset.

```{r}
nc[nc$mage == max(nc$mage), ]
```


##

Fix the following subsetting errors using data from `nc`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nc[nc$visits = 4, ]
nc[-1:4, ]
nc[nc$visits <= 5]
nc[nc$visits == 4 | 6, ]
```
