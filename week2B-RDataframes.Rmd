## Vector Subsetting/Filtering
What's going on here?

```{r}
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
x[x < 10]
x < 10
```

We can index our vector with a logical vector of the same length.


## Subsetting with logicals

```{r}
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
i <- c(F, F, T, F, F)
x[i]
which(x < 10)
x[x < 10] <- 10
x
```


## Useful fact!

```{r}
i <- c(F, F, T, F, F)
sum(i)
mean(i)
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
mean(x > 11)
```


## Logical operators

`<` less than

`<=` less than or equal

`>` greater than

`>=` greater than or equal

`==` exactly equal to

***

`!=` not equal to

`!x` not equal to x

`x | y` x or y

`x & y` x and y


##
How can you subset the following vector to exclude both elements less than 10 
and all even elements? (hint: `%%`)

```{r}
x <- c(12, 15, 8, 11, 24)
```

```{r}
x[x > 10 & x %% 2 == 1]
```
